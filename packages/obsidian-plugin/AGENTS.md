# AGENTS.md (packages/obsidian-plugin)

This directory contains the **Obsidian community plugin** for AILSS.

## Quick facts

- Plugin ID: `ailss-obsidian` (`packages/obsidian-plugin/manifest.json`)
- Desktop-only: spawns a local MCP stdio server process
- Build output: `main.js` (generated by esbuild; do not commit)

## Commands

- Build (production bundle): `pnpm -C packages/obsidian-plugin build`
- Dev (watch): `pnpm -C packages/obsidian-plugin dev`

## Local testing

Obsidian loads plugins from:

- `<Vault>/.obsidian/plugins/<plugin-id>/`

For faster iteration, symlink this folder into a test vault and run watch mode:

```bash
ln -s /absolute/path/to/AILSS-project/packages/obsidian-plugin "<Vault>/.obsidian/plugins/ailss-obsidian"
pnpm -C packages/obsidian-plugin dev
```

## Integration boundary

- Read-only recommendations/search should come from the MCP server tools.
- Any file edits must be behind an explicit user action (apply button, etc.).
