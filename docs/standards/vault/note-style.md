# Note style (optional)

This document contains **optional** Markdown and writing-style conventions for vault notes.

AILSS does not require these conventions for indexing, and the Obsidian plugin prompt installer does **not** bundle this file into `AGENTS.md` by default.

## Obsidian Markdown conventions (optional)

- Headings: use ATX `#` style only. Use H1 once; H2–H4 for most structure.
- Lists: standardize on `-` bullets; indent sub-lists with 2 spaces.
- Code: use triple backticks code fences and specify the language when possible.
- Tables: use pipe (`|`) tables and include a header row.
- Emphasis: use `**bold**` and `*italic*` sparingly (meaning-first).
- Callouts: use Obsidian defaults only (`[!NOTE]`, `[!TIP]`, `[!WARNING]`).

## Language and typography (optional)

- Vault notes are written in Korean using the “~해요” style.
- For technical terms, use Korean + English on first mention (example: frontmatter (metadata)).
- Record date/time in ISO-8601 format (example: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss`).
- Code comments should be short, in Korean, and written as noun phrases (no sentence endings).
- Avoid the middle dot (·) in title/body/lists/tables; prefer commas, hyphens, en dashes (–), semicolons, or conjunctions.
