# Vault rules (moved)

This file is kept as a compatibility pointer.

The canonical vault rules are now split into topic-scoped docs under `docs/standards/vault/`:

- `docs/standards/vault/README.md`
- `docs/standards/vault/assistant-workflow.md`
- `docs/standards/vault/frontmatter-schema.md`
- `docs/standards/vault/typed-links.md`
- `docs/standards/vault/vault-structure.md`

The Obsidian plugin “Prompt installer (vault root)” stitches those docs into a single prompt file (for example `AGENTS.md`) and writes it to the vault root.
