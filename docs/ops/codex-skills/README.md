# Codex skill snapshots

This folder contains **reference snapshots** of a small set of Codex skills used to operate the AILSS Obsidian vault workflow.

Notes:

- These files are **documentation only**.
- The source of truth for installed skills is your local Codex config directory (for example: `~/.codex/skills/`).
- Some skills may mention user-specific absolute paths; treat them as examples.
